# CMPM121-Project
Main project for CMPM121 Fall quarter (Game Mechanics)

ReadMe:

For our game, we decided to implement the Mystery minigame. The player
plays in the first-person perspective, using arrow keys or WASD to move, and
looking around with the mouse. The 'clues' scattered around the scene are 5
enchanted objects, which are denoted by colorful particle effects. When each of
these clues are interacted with by clicking on them, their particle effect goes
away. When all 5 objects are interacted with, Christmas begins and it starts to
snow! The post-processing effect we used for the scene was an anti-aliasing filter
on the main camera.
