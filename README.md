# CMPM121-Project
Main project for CMPM121 Fall quarter (Game Mechanics)

ReadMe:

My scene is a small section of a small town. It shows a single house by the road, 
with a small farm in its backyard and a supermarket next-door. There are woods 
behind the supermarket and a plane flying through the clouds overhead. I included 
bigger objects like houses and supermarkets, but also smaller ones like grass, rocks, 
shrubs, and pumpkins. I looked through the unity asset store to draw inspiration, 
and I consistently liked the simplistic art style of the low polygon scenes I would see. 
So I sought out to make one of my own. The main character in this scene is the object male_1, 
a man dressed in all black standing across the road from the main house, looking towards it.
